      "icon": "🔥",
      "content": "The festival takes its name from Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu. When the king's son Prahlad refused to worship his father and instead remained devoted to Lord Vishnu, the king ordered Holika — who had a boon of fire immunity — to sit in a blazing fire with Prahlad on her lap. But the boon only worked if Holika entered the fire alone. Prahlad emerged unharmed while Holika perished. The bonfire lit on the eve of Holi (Holika Dahan) celebrates this victory of devotion and goodness over evil."

      "title": "Radha & Krishna — The Colours of Love",
      "icon": "💙",
      "content": "The playful throwing of colours is inspired by the legend of Lord Krishna and Radha. Young Krishna, who had dark blue skin, was jealous of Radha's fair complexion. His mother Yashoda playfully suggested he colour Radha's face with any colour he liked. This mischievous act of love became the tradition of smearing friends, family, and strangers with vibrant gulal (coloured powder) and pichkaris (water guns). On Holi, everyone is equal — colour erases all differences."
